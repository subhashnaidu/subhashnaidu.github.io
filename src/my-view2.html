          <p>
              I am currently a Computer Science Student at the University of Central Florida.
              I first came to America when I was 7, and was instantly facinated with the technology here.
              I started learning about all things technology, opening up the home computer, upgrading components, downloading more ram ;), setting up a home media server etc, repairing phones and jailbreaking devices.
              As the field of Computer Science is still new, there are still lots of things to learn, improve and discover. People say that when you do what you love, you don't work a day in your life. We'll I guess its a good thing I am lazy! :)
            </p>
            <p>I am currently in the process of learning Google's TensorFlow API's and new languages like Swift and GoLang in addition to the standerd C and Java. 
              I plan on slowly building my portfolio with a variety of things that I am working on, not just limited to programming and code. I also have passions 
              in Photography and Music production, so expect anything.
