      <p><h1>Designed in America, Made in India</h1></p>
      <p>
          I am currently a Computer Science Student at the University of Central Florida.
          I came to America when I was 7 and I was instantly fascinated with the technology here.
          My curiosity in technology lead me to my eventual career path as a software developer.
          I love being informed on current trends in technology and I am constantly in the process of learning new things.
