      <p>
        I am currently a student at University of Central Florida studying Computer Science.
        I first came to America when i was 7, and was instantly facinated with the technology that was available here.
        I started tinkering with all things technology, opening up the home computer, upgrading components, downloading more ram, setting up a NAS server etc.
      </p>
      <p>As technolgy evolves so have my intrests. I am currently in the process of learning Google's TensorFlow API's and new languages like Swift and GoLang in addition to the standerd C and Java. 
        I plan on slowly building my portfolio with a variety of things that I am working on, not just limited to programming and code. I also have passions 
        in Photography and Music production, so expect anything.
