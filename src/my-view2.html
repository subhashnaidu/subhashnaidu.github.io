          <p>
              I am currently a Computer Science Student at the University of Central Florida.
              I first came to America when I was 7, and was instantly facinated with the technology here.
              I started learning about all things technology, building computers, setting up a home server, downloading more ram, repairing phones and jailbreaking devices.
              I am currently in the process of learning Google's TensorFlow and new languages like Swift and GoLang. 
              I plan on slowly building my portfolio with a variety of things that I am working on, not just limited to programming. I also have a passion 
              in photography and music production, so expect anything.
