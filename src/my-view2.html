        Hi, my name is Subhash Naidu and I am currently a student at University of Central Florida studying Computer Science.
        I first came to America when i was 7. I was facinated with the technology that was available here from a young age.
        I started tinkering with all things technology, trying to figure out how something work. Opening up the home computer, upgrading components or installing various
        Linux Distros. I was also facinated with software concepts like virtualization and baremetal hypervisors.
      </p>
      <p>Now my intrests have grown, to more complex topics such as Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Data Science and Computer Security. I am currently in
      the process of learning Google's TensorFlow API's and new languages like Swift and GoLang in addition to the standerd C and Java. I plan on slowly building my
      portfolio with a variety of things that I am working on, not just limited to programming and code. I also have passions in Photography and Music production, so expect anything.
      </p>
