      <p><h1>Designed in America, Made in India</h1></p>
      <p>
          I am currently a Computer Science Student at the University of Central Florida.
          I came to America when I was 7 and I was instantly facinated with the technology here.
          My curiosity in technology lead me to my eventual career path as a software developer.
          I love being informed on current trends in technology. I am currently in the process of learning Google's TensorFlow
          and new languages like Swift and GoLang. I plan on slowly building my portfolio with a variety of projects that I am working on, not just limited to programming. 
          I also have a passion in photography and music production, so expect anything.
