      <p text-align="left">I set foot in California when i was 7, arriving at a completetly different world then the one I was previously used to.
       Maybe it was the Silicon in the air or something, but i became facinated with computers at a young age, I remember the colorful plastic imacs,
       I used in elementary school. Fast forward 13 years later, I've been in Florida for the past 12 years, going to UCF for a Computer Science Degree.
      </p>
      <p> Now my intrests have grown, to more complex things such as Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Data Science and Computer Security. I am currently in
      the process of learning Google's TensorFlow API's and new languages like Swift and GoLang in addition to the standerd C and Java. I plan on slowly building my
      portfolio with a variety of things that I am working on, not just limited to programming and code. I also have passions in Photography and Music production, so expect anything.
