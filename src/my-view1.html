      <p class="card-text">This website was created using Google's Polymer Components,
         which are part of their Material UI language. This responsive website seamlessly
         transitions based on the device your using. Try it by resizing the
         browser window to create a narrow rectangle much like a phone screen, or
         visit the website on a phone and watch the website adapt. Google has made great advancements in trying
         to create a first class web experience on android, by allowing website to be treated as apps in regards to the
         operating system. They also brought some of their technology from mobile to the web.
