      <h2>Personal Contact Manager</h2>
      <img src="../src/m2.png" data-id="Mean Stack">
      <p> A personal contact manager application built by me and my peers as part of a group project. It includes basic functionality such as add, delete, and search
          including user registration and login. I was responsible for some frontend UI using Angular2 as well as some backend setup using MongoDB. We decided to use the 
          MEAN stack which inolves, Mongodb, Express, Angular and Node.

      <p class="card-text">This website was created using Google's Polymer Web Components,
         which are a part of Google's Material UI design language. This responsive website seamlessly
         transitions between mobile and desktop views. Try it by resizing the
         browser window to create a narrow rectangle much like a phone screen, or
         visit the website on a phone and watch the website adapt. Google has made great advancements in trying
         to create a first class web experience on android, by allowing website to be treated as apps in regards to the
         operating system. They also brought some of their technology from mobile to the web.
